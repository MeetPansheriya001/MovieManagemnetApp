# 🎬 Movie Management Application 🎥

## Summary

This project involves developing a movie management system using Spring MVC and Thymeleaf. The application allows users to manage a list of movies and display them according to their release year. The project demonstrates skills in Java, Spring MVC, Thymeleaf, JDBC, and SQL.

## Features

- **📝 POJO Creation**: Defined a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) for movies with attributes: id, name, genre, and release year.

- **🗄️ Database Schema**: Created a SQL schema (`schema.sql`) to define the movies table in the database.

- **🔧 Controller Implementation**: 
  - Handled HTTP GET requests to retrieve and display all movies.
  - Handled HTTP POST requests to add new movies to the database.
  - Implemented functionality to filter and display movies by release year.

- **🌐 Thymeleaf Integration**: 
  - Designed dynamic web pages to display movie data.
  - Implemented form binding for user inputs.
  - Styled the pages for a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- **☕ Java**: Core programming language used for the application.

- **🔄 Spring MVC**: Framework used to handle the web layer and controller logic.

- **🍃 Thymeleaf**: Template engine for rendering dynamic web content.

- **🗃️ JDBC**: Template used for database interactions.

- **📝 SQL**: Used to create and manage the movies table in the database.

## Instructions

1. **📄 POJO Definition**: Define a class `Movie` with attributes: id, name, genre, and release year.

2. **💾 Database Setup**: Create a `schema.sql` file to define the movies table.

3. **🔧 Controller Setup**: Implement methods to handle HTTP GET and POST requests.

4. **🌐 Thymeleaf Integration**: Design web pages to display movie data.

5. **🚀 Run the Application**: Deploy the application on a server and access the web interface to manage movies.

## Project Structure

- **🗃️ Model**: Contains the `Movie` POJO and database interaction logic.

- **🔧 Controller**: Handles HTTP requests and manages interactions between the model and view.

- **🌐 View**: Contains Thymeleaf templates for displaying movie data.
